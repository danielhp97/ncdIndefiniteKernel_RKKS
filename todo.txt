alterar algumas merdas:


primeiro, por iteraçoes no yaml do dvc: trocar o parametro numero de folds para uma lista.
nuances:
    - so se pode fazer o label, split e subset na primeira iteração
depois, aplicar para cada consequente step.
perguntas:
    - será necessário por os dois parametros? (lista + max de k folds), achoq  sim.

ta fodido os csv com os caminhos train test. done.


##### kernel paper apontamentos
cada matriz ( kernel) é a gram matrix de cada uma destas feature functions

Lf = f(i) . f(i)

as feeature functions sao normaliozadas:
||f(i)||^2 = 1



feature extraction methods:
(2 variants)
- color: transformed into histograms of 8/64 bins (how to do it)
(2 variants) https://pypi.org/project/pyvlfeat/ # cant install
- sift: images are processed to sift descriptiors, clustered to 256 or 512 clusters. feature vector is the histogram of the closest descriptiors
(1 variant) http://bemlar.ism.ac.jp/zhuang/Refs/Refs/ogata1985.pdf https://github.com/whitphx/lear-gist-python
- gist: 960 dim feature vectors with various properties like openess, roughness, naturalness

then these methods are replicated only for the center of the image (retangulo com metade das dimensoes originais centrado)
we have then the 10 kernels

45 pairwise combination kernels concatenated:
concatenam todas os pares de kernels acima descritos e formam 45 pairwise combination kernels

THEN we add a p constant hyperparameter

p increases: all images appear similar (increasing repulsion)

p is chosen independentely and each category






    #heatmap kernel matrix
    # plot dist. size of images feito
    # save images as temp on ncd instead of getting size from BytesIO feito

    criar o tiff test . pegar ans 3 imagens  ✅

    comparar Original1: class1 (perto de 1)
            Original1: class2 (?)
            Original1: Original1 (perto de 0)
    pegar em 3 images: 1 da classe 1, outra da classe 1, uma da classe 2 o mais diferente possivel.


    testar distancias com tiff ✅ só e com paq9        

    ^^^^faazer hoje
    vvvvv com tempo olhar para isto: pelo menos por os auc direitinhos.

    depois, extra:

    pegar nos gráficos de AUC e pô-los bonitos

    implementar um TIFF na pipeline principal

    insights:

    TIFF is not a good format as it is losslesss: all the files are the same size.*

    PNG is where the differences between images are noticed the most. Problem, I dont understand why, but the NCD is bigger than one.
    The concatenated size is just too big for the single images.

    This result may explain the values in JPEG: they are more or less a tenth of the values of png, the problem may not be with the compression itself
    but withe the NCD calculation method.
    * after the NCD calculation, it is worth it to re-check the TIFF

    # checks to see if the compression is applicable. IT is a NORMAL COMPRESSION if:

    Idempotence: |𝐶(𝑋𝑋)|=|𝐶(𝑋)| and |𝐶(𝜆)|=0, where 𝜆 is the empty string. 

    Monotonicity: |𝐶(𝑋𝑌)|≥|𝐶(𝑋)|. ✅

    Symmetry: |𝐶(𝑋𝑌)|=|𝐶(𝑌𝑋)|. ✅

    Distributivity: |𝐶(𝑋𝑌)|+|𝐶(𝑍)|≤|𝐶(𝑋𝑍)|+|𝐶(𝑌𝑍)|.

    where C(X) denotes the string 𝑋′ resulting from the application of compressor C to string X,
    XY denotes the concatenation of X and Y,  
    and |X| denotes the length of string (or file) X.


    The problem may be in Idempotence.
    the idempotence property says simply that if an object comprises a simple duplication of a smaller object,
    the compression algorithm should be able to take advantage of that, 
    and come close to compressing it to the size to which it can compress the smaller object
    
    Our experiments have shown serious violation of the idempotence axiom that has been used to prove theoretical properties of NCD,
    leaving a potential gap between theory and practice. 

     original definition of NCD, J is simply concatenation.
     In an ideal world, J would locate similar chunks of X and Y and place them adjacently.
     However, if J is too destructive of the original strings, 
      much of the original compression of X and Y individually will be lost,
      resulting in a higher overall value for NCD𝐶,𝐽(𝑋,𝑌)


    Interleaving -> The simplest approach is to assume that similar parts of x and y are similarly located,
        and just weave them together in chunks of size b;

        > We can test Merging different image bands:
            - Create a new image
            Separate the bands of to images 
            Join bands on new image
            calculate size of that image.
            (to be used with PNG, lets see results.)
            on string comparison there was a big (30% jump) accuracy increase - according to the article

    NCD-shuffle -> Another approach is to split both strings into chunks of the desired size 
    (selected to be appropriate for the compression algorithm) 
    and apply the traditional NCD to determine the similarity of each chunk of X to each chunk of Y, 
    and align them accordingly, with the most similar chunks from the two strings adjacent.



hj, vamos tratar do Interleaving,
    testar todas as combinações e depois testar uma imagem média de todas as combinações ✅

perceber como funciona o NCD-shuffle 


Hoje:

Change params.yaml to add "Concatenation Type" - "NP Concatenation", "Interleaving", "NCD SHUFFLE" ✅
                      add "Compression Type" - "TIFF", "JPEG", "PNG" ✅

Change kernel_calc and ncd to simplify those parameters:
    Probably need to change the order of operations: first calculate concatenated image then calculate the ncd given the compression

documented everything ✅
need to change ncd_matrix 

ncd_matrix(list_of_images):
    n = len(list_images)
    K = (n,n)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i,n):
            K[i,j] = ncd_general(Image.fromarray(list[i]),Image.fromarray(list[j]))
            K[j,i] = K[i,j]
    return K

ncd_general(img1, img2):
    case concatenation_type = "interleaved":
        concat1 = Image.fromarray(img1)
        concat2 = Image.fromarray(img2)
        len_concat_image = concat_image_calc(img1,img2)
    case concatenation_type = "classic":
        #
    ncd_value = ncd_calc(img1,img2, len_concat_image, params['compression_type'])
    return ncd_value

concat_image_calc(img1,img2):
    return self.interleave_img(img1, img2, 'RGB')


ncd_calc(img1,img2,concat, param):
    len1 = Image_to_byte(img1,param)
    len2 = Image_to_byte(img2, param)
    concat_image_len = Image_to_byte(concat_image, param)
    return ncd_formula(lenx,leny,lenconcat)

ncd_formula(len1, len2, lenconcat):
    return (len(concat) - min(len1, len2)) / max(lenx, leny)
